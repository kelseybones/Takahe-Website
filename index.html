			<p class="align-left">In New Zealand's rugged Fiordland a bird thought
			extinct for fifty years is struggling for survival. Behind the rare species
			in its fight for life is all the protective power of the Dominion
			Government.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">Rediscovery of this flightless bird, the large,
			brilliant-hued native rail which the Maoris called takahea, meaning
			"wandering at large," excited almost as much interest in New Zealand as
			discovery of a living passenger pigeon would arouse in America.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">To zoologists and bird lovers throughout the world,
			reappearance of takahea, now called the takahe, was a notable event. They
			had a scientific name for the creature “Notornis hochstetteri, the first
			half of which means "bird of the south"“but they knew tantalizingly little
			about it and had considered it lost in the limbo of vanished
			species.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">To the rediscoverer, Dr. G. B. Orbell, a physician of
			Invercargill, New Zealand, the dramatic sight of a takahe alive came as the
			reward of years of patient and systematic search. Only four of the birds
			were known to science when he made his discovery on the shore of a lake in
			what is now called Notornis Valley.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">Since August, 1898, there had been no authentic report
			of one being caught, or even seen.</p>

			<h1 class="align-left">FUTILE WINGS HAVE THREE FOOT SPAN</h1><br>
			<p class="align-left">A primitive type of large moor hen found only in New
			Zealand, the takahe is unlike any other member of the world-wide rail family
			to which it belongs.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">For example, despite its membership in an aquatic
			family, it avoids swamps and rivers. It does, however, share some of the
			clan 's characteristics, such as a large frontal shield.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">The full-grown takahe stands some twenty inches high
			and weighs about six pounds. The wings, though incapable of flight, may have
			a three-foot span.The adult bird is vividly colored. Head, neck, breast, and
			flanks are an iridescent indigo blue, becoming brighter on the shoulders and
			changing to a malachite green on the mantle.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">The dark rump and upper tail coverts are olive green,
			the abdomen and thighs purplish black, and the under tail coverts white. The
			powerful beak is scarlet at the base, fading outwards to a wax pink. Legs
			and feet are red, eyes reddish brown.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">This brilliant color scheme is seen to full advantage
			only when the bird is approaching the observer or passing at right angles to
			him. In contrast to its showy parents, the young takahe wears only a
			uniform, soft black down. The black beak is white-tipped, and the
			disproportionately large legs are a pale purple. In New Zealand's
			ornithological history, extinction, or near extinction, has been the lot of
			many species as a result of settlement.</p>

			<q>It originally occurred throughout forest and grass ecosystems. Today it
			is restricted to alpine tussock grasslands on the mainland and feeds
			primarily on juices from the bases of snow tussock and a species of fern
			rhizome. It eats introduced grasses on the islands, It usually lays two eggs
			and chicks can begin breeding at the end of their first year, but usually
			start in their second. It is long-lived, probably 14-20 years.</q>

			<h1 class="align-left">Vanished Birds Include 12-Foot Moa</h1><br>
			<p class="align-left">Before the arrival of Capt. James Cook in 1769, birds
			were the dominant land vertebrates. The only land mammals were the dog, a
			Polynesian rat, and two species of bats. The dog and rat had been introduced
			by the Maoris on their second migration, about A. D. 1150. *</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">After the Maoris had caused the extinction of the huge
			flightless moa, one species of which was twelve feet high, European
			settlement brought about more extensive changes. Ferrets, stoats, and
			weasels were introduced to control a plague of rabbits, and these, with
			cats, dogs, and other predators, virtually sealed the fate of numerous
			native species, among them the takahe.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">The first living takahe known to Europeans was
			purposely killed and eaten. It was caught by a sealing gang on Resolution
			Island, near the southwest end of South Island , in 1849. Two years later a
			party of Maoris caught a second bird in Thompson Sound, about forty miles
			farther north.</p><br>
			<br>
			<p class="align-left">Luckily, the skins of both birds were obtained by Mr.
			W. D. B. Mantell, who in 1847 had discovered the semi fossil remains of the
			North Island variety (duly named Notornis mantelli by Sir Richard Owen, of
			London). The skins were sent to the British Museum.</p>
